## My process
I began with the mobile design first, and for this particular project I found that media queries were not necessary. I created my containers first and then worked on styling from the top of the page, down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My biggest challenge in this project for me was creating an overlay for the image on hover. Definitely took quite a bit of trial and error and research.

### Continued development

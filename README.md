## My process
I began with the mobile design first, and for this particular project I found that media queries were not necessary. I created my containers first and then worked on styling from the top of the page, down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My biggest challenge in this project for me was creating an overlay for the image on hover. Definitely took quite a bit of trial and error and research.

### Continued development

I'm going to practice image overlays so I can become more comfortable with those.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This really helped me get the image overlay figured out.
